# Honours_Workflow

This GitHub repository contains the code for my Honours research project titled 'Exploring the Geodynamic Setting of Enigmatic Mineral Systems'. The aim of the project is to investigate the lithospheric thickness relationships of some ore deposits, as well as formational mechanisms of the sedimentary basins in which they form.

This markdown file includes a summary of the two IPython notebooks this comprise this repository.

#### Spatial_dist.ipynb
This notebook displays the workflow of the spatial analysis aspect of my project. Deposit information and lithospheric depth data are used to calculate cumulative distribution frequencies (CDF) and associated probabilities, providing quantitative constraints on the lithospheric relationship of each deposit type. 

The code for the figures featured in my thesis are also provided in the notebook. This includes: maps, CDF plots, D value histograms and probability violinplots.

#### Temporal_dist.ipynb
This notebook displays the workflow of the temporal distribution analysis portion of my project. Sedimentary column data are used to calculate water-loaded subsidence for a sedimentary basin. Thermal modelling data are used to produce RMS misfits against the observed subsidence, providing insights to basin forming mechanisms and their role in metallogenesis.

The code for the figures featured in my thesis are also provided in the notebook. This includes: subsidence curves, heatflow plots and misfit contour plots.
